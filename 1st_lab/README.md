### 2.b  

Number of Commited Instructions = 5028  
Number of ops (including micro ops) committed = 5834 
 
> The number differs because in the second case we include the micro operations of the system which are not a part of the simulation

### 2.c

Number of overall L2 Cache (read+write) accesses = 479  
We could also calculate the number of accesses by adding the values of L2 cpus.inst = 332 and cpus.data = 147 which is the equivalent of 479.

## 3. IN-ORDER CPU's:
There are 4 differnet models of IN_ORDER CPU's in gem5:
 * SimpleCPU
 * 03CPU
 * TraceCPU
 * MinorCPU Model  
 ### SimpleCPU:  
 The SimpleCPU is a purely functional, in-order model that is suited for cases where a detailed model is not necessary. This can include warm-up 	periods, client systems that are driving a host, or just testing to make sure a program works.  
 
##### The Simple CPU can be broken up into three classes with different memory systems:**   
  * BaseSimpleCPU
  * AtomicSimpleCPU 
  * TimingSimpleCPU
 	
**BaseSimpleCPU**

The BaseSimpleCPU serves several purposes:
 * Holds architected state, stats common across the SimpleCPU models.
 * Defines functions for checking for interrupts, setting up a fetch request, handling pre-execute setup, handling post-execute actions, and advancing the PC to the next instruction. These functions are also common across the SimpleCPU models.
 * Implements the ExecContext interface. 
 
The BaseSimpleCPU can not be run on its own. You must use one of the classes that inherits from BaseSimpleCPU, either AtomicSimpleCPU or TimingSimpleCPU.

**AtomicSimpleCPU**

The AtomicSimpleCPU is the version of SimpleCPU that uses atomic memory accesses (see Memory systems for details). It uses the latency estimates from the atomic accesses to estimate overall cache access time. The AtomicSimpleCPU is derived from BaseSimpleCPU, and implements functions to read and write memory, and also to tick, which defines what happens every CPU cycle. It defines the port that is used to hook up to memory, and connects the CPU to the cache.

**TimingSimpleCPU**

The TimingSimpleCPU is the version of SimpleCPU that uses timing memory accesses (see Memory systems for details). It stalls on cache accesses and waits for the memory system to respond prior to proceeding. Like the AtomicSimpleCPU, the TimingSimpleCPU is also derived from BaseSimpleCPU, and implements the same set of functions. It defines the port that is used to hook up to memory, and connects the CPU to the cache. It also defines the necessary functions for handling the response from memory to the accesses sent out.

You can find reference [here](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/cpu_models/SimpleCPU)

### O3CPU  

The O3CPU is our new detailed model for the v2.0 release. It is an out of order CPU model loosely based on the Alpha 21264. This page will give you a general overview of the O3CPU model, the pipeline stages and the pipeline resources. We have made efforts to keep the code well documented, so please browse the code for exact details on how each part of the O3CPU works

You can find reference [here](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/cpu_models/O3CPU)

### TraceCPU

The Trace CPU model plays back elastic traces, which are dependency and timing annotated traces generated by the Elastic Trace Probe attached to the O3 CPU model. The focus of the Trace CPU model is to achieve memory-system (cache-hierarchy, interconnects and main memory) performance exploration in a fast and reasonably accurate way instead of using the detailed but slow O3 CPU model. The traces have been developed for single-threaded benchmarks simulating in both SE and FS mode. They have been correlated for 15 memory-sensitive SPEC 2006 benchmarks and a handful of HPC proxy apps by interfacing the Trace CPU with classic memory system and varying cache design parameters and DRAM memory type. In general, elastic traces can be ported to other simulation environments.

You can find reference [here](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/cpu_models/TraceCPU)

### MinorCPU

Minor is an in-order processor model with a fixed pipeline but configurable data structures and execute behaviour. It is intended to be used to model processors with strict in-order execution behaviour and allows visualisation of an instructionâ€™s position in the pipeline through the MinorTrace/minorview.py format/tool. The intention is to provide a framework for micro-architecturally correlating the model with a particular, chosen processor with similar capabilities.

### 3.a
The program that I created and used for my simulations is [myprog.c](https://github.com/christos99/9432_Christos_Chrysikos/blob/main/Results%20Folder/myprog.c) with then i compiled for arm into [myprog_arm](https://github.com/christos99/9432_Christos_Chrysikos/blob/main/Results%20Folder/myprog_arm):
		 
		//A simple program that prints a "A sample C program" output
		#include<stdio.h>
		
		int main()
		{
			printf("\nA sample C program\n\n");
		return 0;
		
		}
		//end

### 3.b

Time difference between the 2 simulations  = 0.000037 - 0.000033 = 0.000004s


>The TimingSimpleCPU is the version of SimpleCPU that uses timing memory accesses. It stalls on cache accesses and waits for the memory system to respond prior to proceeding. Regardless the time differnce is unsignificant and we can't run into any assumptions for the general performance difference of this 2 processors referring to this simulation and that occurs because the systems are almost identical with the only exception being the CPU model.

> As we see using the MinorCPU model in all the simulation had not significant but faster simulation time than using the TimingSimpleCPU this is a result of the difference in the architecture that those models have and mostly in the way they use the memmory of the processor.
